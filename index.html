            <h3>Our Specialties</h3>
            <p>We offer a wide variety of croissant-based dishes, from classic butter croissants to extravagant lobster-filled croissants. And my favorite, sprinkle croissants. These are croissants that have just sprinkles on them and they are so good. So good I'm cancelling all the other croissants. We only sell sprinkle croissants.</p>

        <h3>Our Menu</h3>
        <p>Our menu is simple. </br> </br>
             • Sprinkle. Croissant </br> </br>
            That's it. That's the menu. We only sell sprinkle croissants. Mark, my business partner, thinks sprinkle croissants are dumb. He says they look like desserts but taste like regular croissants. Mark is an idiot and I HATE Mark.</p>

        <h3>About Us</h3>

    <section class="hours">
        <h3>Operating Hours</h3>
        <p>The population of a city doesn't even matter. You can sell anything to anyone, especially when they have sprinkles on them. Just because there are only 11,000 people in Guthrie doesn't mean anything.</p>
